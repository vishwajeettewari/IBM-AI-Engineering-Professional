    "TensorFlow defines computations as Graphs, and these are made with operations (also know as “ops”). So, when we work with TensorFlow, it is the same as defining a series of operations in a Graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "To execute these operations as computations, we must launch the Graph into a Session. The session translates and passes the operations represented into the graphs to the device you want to execute them on, be it a GPU or CPU. In fact, TensorFlow's capability to execute the code on different devices such as CPUs and GPUs is a consequence of it's specific structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the image below represents a graph in TensorFlow. <b>W</b>, <b>x</b> and b are tensors over the edges of this graph. <b>MatMul</b> is an operation over the tensors <b>W</b> and <b>x</b>, after that <b>Add</b> is called and add the result of the previous operator with <b>b</b>. The resultant tensors of each operation cross the next one until the end where it's possible to get the wanted result."

    "The Tensor structure helps us by giving the freedom to shape the dataset in the way we want.\n",

    "And it is particularly helpful when dealing with images, due to the nature of how information in images are encoded,\n",
    "\n",
    "Thinking about images, its easy to understand that it has a height and width, so it would make sense to represent the information contained in it with a two dimensional structure (a matrix)... until you remember that images have colors, and to add information about the colors, we need another dimension, and thats when Tensors become particularly helpful.\n",
    "\n",
    "Images are encoded into color channels, the image data is represented into each color intensity in a color channel at a given point, the most common one being RGB, which means Red, Blue and Green. The information contained into an image is the intensity of each channel color into the width and height of the image, just like this:\n",
